Using Machine Learning methods to 'make money' betting on NBA games
####Everything you need to develop Machine Learning NBA models in Python
We demonstrate how to

1. Scrape data from the web
2. Clean and organize data efficiently
3. Organize and build a complex ML model
4. Run an ML model and evaluate results. 


## File Organization
* **BoxScores** Files for scraping boxscores/betting info from the web
* **Scripts** Scripts for cleaning/organizing data
* **Predictor** ML model organization and implementation


## TO-DO
* Bayesian Optimization
* Increase complexity of feature space
* Get more detailed data
